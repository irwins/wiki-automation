Developers are user with a specific need. Basic source code practices have been implemented.

## Add README.md to source code
Where necessary README.md have been written for more in-depth explanation. A README needs to be concise, informative, accurate, and up to date. As you continue working on code, make sure to keep the README current with the changes you make. Along with serving as a cheat sheet for the code repository, a README often serves as the basis for more comprehensive user-facing documentation. If you follow this chapter’s example template in your README, your users will likely have what they need to get started.

Point to consider from a developer's perspective:

- Developer skill
- Programming languages
- Developer environment
- Operating system
- Team role

## Outline your developer's need

Here a few general questions that apply to any product being developed/launched

- How do I authenticate against your API?
- How do I use a specific feature?
- How do I troubleshoot a specific problem?

## Skillset necessary to maintain code base

|  Developer skillset  |   |
|--|--|
| Developer skill |  Beginner-Intermediate-Advanced|
| Languages |  PowerShell, Terraform HCL |
| Developer environment | MacOS, **Windows** |
| Role | Lead developer |

## Comment to help future developers understand

The tenets for good code comments are to:
- Keep them brief
- Make them relevant
- Use them liberally, but not excessively

Even as a solitary developer working on a project, code comments can be a tremendous help. If you’ve put code aside and returned to it after weeks or months, you may have experienced bewilderment at what you were doing or why you made certain choices. Comments help you reorient to your own code.
