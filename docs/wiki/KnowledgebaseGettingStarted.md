## Getting started docs

These are your opportunity to help users get up and running and to build trust
with your users that you will guide and support them with good resources.

As you write a getting started document, some questions you should ask
yourself are:

• What are the quickest explanations of what this service is and what its core features do?
• What are the simplest steps to install and use your product?
• What are the most important questions new users will have?
• What are the cool things they can do with your service?
