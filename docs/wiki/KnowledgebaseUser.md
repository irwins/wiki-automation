# User documentation

Point to consider from a user's perspective:
- Identifying the goals you have for your users
- Understanding who your users are
-  Understanding your users’ needs and how
documentation addresses them

## Outline your user's need

Here a few general questions that apply to any product being developed/launched

>I.S. 20211018 I'll be the first to admit not having the big picture but that shouldn't deter us from documenting... :-)

• What is this product?
• Will this product solve my problem?
• What features are available?
• How much does it cost?
• How do I get started?
