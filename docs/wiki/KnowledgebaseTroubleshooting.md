## Introduction

A documented workaround shows users a solution that may not be intuitive, but still gets the job done despite known limitations. It’s valuable to be transparent with known issues and bugs to save your users time, as they’re going to discover them anyway. Known limitations typically include edge cases—actions that you may not have expected or recommended users to attempt. Be clear with your users about which edge cases are unsupported. When organizing troubleshooting information, it’s best to avoid too much explanation on why the problem happens and focus instead on the workaround. Make sure you include a solution (or fix) with the description.
