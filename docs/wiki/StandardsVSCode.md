# Extensions

The preferred IDE is vscode. Here's a list of extensions necessary to be productive when developing for the Bicep project.

## Required

- Azure CLI Tool /extension
- Git CLI tool
- PowerShell 5.x/7.x
- Beautify
- Git Graph
- PowerShell
- Trailing Spaces
- Draw.io Integration
- vscode-icons

## Nice to have

- Better comments
- Bracket Pair Colorizer
- Code Spell Checker

## Codespaces / DEV containers

[Codespaces](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/about-codespaces]) will soon be the new norm when it comes to onboarding developers when released.
